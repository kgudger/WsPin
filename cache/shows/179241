There’s 104 years of history behind this show--years of women crossing many nations and facing all kinds of odds to make a world that works better for us all. And this work is still going on, as powerful as ever. Our show brings that story home, here and now, in Santa Cruz, and in real time. We air interviews with local people who are finding real ways out of the mess we’re in--with stories, ideas, successes and strategies connecting across issues to achieve systems change.</p>","since":null,"url":"","hide_dj":0,"image":"https://spinitron.com/images/Show/17/92/179241-img_show-original.jpg?v=1577561363","_links":{"self":{"href":"https://spinitron.com/api/shows/179241"},"personas":[{"href":"https://spinitron.com/api/personas/137614"}],"playlists":{"href":"/api/playlists?show_id=179241"}}}
