Why Puro Pulpo? Calamar was already taken and I decided to honor a different kind of Cephalopod: “un pulpo.” The other names that, sadly, I rejected were: Calamar Para Sanar (“squid for healing”) and, my mother’s suggestion, “Calamar es la Cura.” “Calamar es la Cura” means “Squid is the Cure.” Spoken too quickly, however, sounds a lot like “Calamar es locura” which means “Squid is insanity/madness.” Not the vibe that I am trying to create for the show. I feel honored to be working at KSQD and delighted to be able to share music that I feel passionately about with you. </p>","since":2019,"url":"","hide_dj":0,"image":"https://spinitron.com/images/Show/19/62/196271-img_show-original.jpg?v=1593566493","_links":{"self":{"href":"https://spinitron.com/api/shows/196271"},"personas":[{"href":"https://spinitron.com/api/personas/145216"}],"playlists":{"href":"/api/playlists?show_id=196271"}}}
